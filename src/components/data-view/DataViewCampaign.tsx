                  It's not a good practice to store long or dynamic strings directly in a smart contract, as on-chain storage is expensive and inefficient.
                  Instead, it's recommended to store only essential data (like short identifiers) and keep larger or changing content off-chain,
                  referencing them by their hash or CID in the contract. This approach reduces gas costs and improves scalability while maintaining data integrity.

                  For this project, I included the campaign title directly in the on-chain metadata field as a simple example â€” in a real-world scenario, this kind of
                  information would typically be stored off-chain.
