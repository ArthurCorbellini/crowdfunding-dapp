              It's not a good practice to store long or dynamic strings directly in a smart contract, as on-chain storage is expensive and inefficient.
              Instead, it's recommended to store only essential data (like short identifiers) and keep larger or changing content off-chain,
              referencing them by their hash or CID in the contract. This approach reduces gas costs and improves scalability while maintaining data integrity.

              For this project, I included the campaign title directly in the on-chain metadata field as a simple example â€” in a real-world scenario, this kind of
              information would typically be stored off-chain.
