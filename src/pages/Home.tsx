        <P>
          This is a Web3 crowdfunding dapp built with <strong>Sway</strong> on the <strong>Fuel Network</strong>. It allows users to <strong>create crowdfunding campaigns</strong>, make <strong>token-based donations</strong>, and handle <strong>withdrawals or refunds</strong> based on campaign outcomes.
          Each campaign includes a title, a funding goal, and a deadline. Users can donate to active campaigns, and once the goal is reached and the deadline has passed, the campaign creator can withdraw the funds.
          If the goal is not reached by the deadline, donors are eligible to claim refunds.
